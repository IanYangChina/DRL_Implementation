### Some tips

To run the FetchReach-v1 environment, you will need to install gym, mujoco and mujoco.py on your environment.
Here's the links:  

[OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)  
[Get a free Mujoco trial license, here](https://www.roboti.us/license.html)  
[Install Mujoco and Mujoco.py by OpenAI, here](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)  

Unfortunately, it seems that mujoco is hard to be installed on Windows systems, but you might find some help in [this
page](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py/issues/253). However, I still suggest you to run these codes on Linux systems.
